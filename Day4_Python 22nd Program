Given two integers, M and N, calculate the sum of the cubes of all integers from M to N inclusive. If M is greater than N, the result should be zero or an appropriate message should be displayed.

Example:

Input:

M = 2 N = 4

Output:

63

Explanation: The sum of the cubes of 2, 3, and 4 is 8 + 27 + 64 = 99.

Input Format

The input will consist of two integers, M and N, where M and N could be any integer, positive or negative.

Constraints
