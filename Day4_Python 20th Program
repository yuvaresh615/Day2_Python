The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are:

If n is even: n = n / 2
If n is odd: n = 3n + 1
For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is:

5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
It has been proved that for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.

Given a positive integer, write a program to print this sequence and the number of times this rule needs to be applied in order to reach 1.
