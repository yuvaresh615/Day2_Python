Sanjay wants to know whether the user input is Automorphic number or not.

For example,

    The Automorphic number is square of the number ends with the Same number. 
    Square of 5 is 25,its ends with the value of 5.
    so the number 5 is Automorphic Number.
could you please help him to find it and implements in program.

Invalid Input

#code:
n = int(input())
if n <= 1 or n >= 10:
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    square = n * n
    if square % 10 == n:
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is Automorphic Number")
    else:
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is Not Automorphic Number")
