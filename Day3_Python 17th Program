In a theater, there is a discount scheme announced where one gets a 10% discount on the total cost of tickets when there is a bulk booking of more than 20 tickets, and a discount of 2% on the total cost of tickets if a special coupon card is submitted. Develop a program to find the total cost as per the scheme. The cost of the k class ticket is Rs.75 and q class is Rs.150. Refreshments can also be opted by paying an additional of Rs. 50 per member.

**Hint: **k and q and You have to book minimum of 5 tickets and maximum of 40 at a time. If fails display “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”. If circle is given a value other than ‘k’ or ‘q’ the output should be “Invalid Input”.
