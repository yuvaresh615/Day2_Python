Sample Output 1

Area of Square=4
Area of Rectangle=12
Area of Circle=78.53
Area of Triangle=21

code:
a = int(input())
l = int(input())
b = int(input())
r = int(input())
B = int(input())
h = int(input())

pi = 3.14159
square = a*a
rectangle = l*b
circle = pi*r*r
circle1 = int(circle * 100) / 100
triangle = (1/2)*(B*h)
print(f"Area of Square={square}")
print(f"Area of Rectangle={rectangle}")
print(f"Area of Circle={circle1}")
print(f"Area of Triangle={int(triangle)}")
