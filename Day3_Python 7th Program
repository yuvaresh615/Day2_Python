Sanjay wants to learn the calculation of integer digits.could you please help him to implements the sum of digits in programming. Notes:- - If the integer is 45,separate the each digits (4+5) the output is 9.

Input Format

input consists of one integer.
Constraints

Given N is greater than 9 and lesser than 99
Output Format

execute the sum of digits values. Notes:-
If the input is above 100, execute the statements is "Invalid Input".
Sample Input 0

23
Sample Output 0

Sum of Digit 23 is 005
Sample Input 1

56
Sample Output 1

Sum of Digit 56 is 011
Sample Input 2

100
Sample Output 2

Invalid Input

#code:
num = int(input())
sum1 = 0
if(num > 9 and num < 100):
    rem = num%10
    num1 = num//10
    sum1 = num1 + rem
    print(f"Sum of Digit {num} is {sum1:03}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
